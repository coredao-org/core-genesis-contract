# Core Genesis Contracts

This repo holds all the genesis contracts on Core blockchain, which are part of the core implementations of Satoshi Plus consensus. For more information about Core blockchain and Satoshi Plus consensus, please read the [technical whitepaper](https://whitepaper.coredao.org/core-white-paper-v1.0.7).



## List of Contracts

- [BTCLightClient.sol](./contracts/BtcLightClient.sol): This contract implements a BTC light client on Core blockchain. Relayers store BTC blocks to Core blockchain by calling this contract. This contract calculates powers of BTC miners in each round, which is used to calculate hybrid score and reward distribution.
- [Burn.sol](./contracts/Burn.sol): This contract burns CORE tokens up to pre defined CAP.
- [CandidateHub.sol](./contracts/CandidateHub.sol): This contract manages all validator candidates on Core blockchain. It also exposes the method `turnRound` for the consensus engine to execute the `turn round` workflow. 
- [Foundation.sol](./contracts/Foundation.sol): This is the DAO Treasury smart contract. The funds in this contract can only be moved through governance vote. 
- [GovHub.sol](./contracts/GovHub.sol): This is the smart contract to manage governance votes.
- [PledgeAgent.sol](./contracts/PledgeAgent.sol): This contract manages user delegate, also known as stake, including both coin delegate and hash delegate.
- [RelayerHub.sol](./contracts/RelayerHub.sol): This contract manages BTC relayers on Core blockchain.
- [SlashIndicator.sol](./contracts/SlashIndicator.sol): This contract manages slash/jail operations to validators on Core blockchain.
- [SystemReward.sol](./contracts/SystemReward.sol): This smart contract manages funds for relayers and verifiers.
- [ValidatorSet.sol](./contracts/ValidatorSet.sol): This contract manages elected validators in each round. All rewards for validators on Core blockchain are minted in genesis block and stored in this contract. 



## Prepare
Install ganache globally:
```shell script
npm install -g ganache
```

Install dependency:
```shell script
npm install
```

## Run Tests

```shell
# install test dependency
pip install -r requirements.txt
brownie pm install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.9.6

# generate contracts for testing
./generate-test-contracts.sh

# run brownie tests
brownie test -v --stateful false
# run brownie tests in a single file
brownie test tests/{the-file-name.py} -v
# run brownie with a single testcase
brownie test -k <method-name> -v
```



Flatten all system contracts:

```shell script
npm run flatten
```



## Generate genesis.json

1. Edit `init_holders.js` file to alloc the initial CORE holders.
2. Edit `validators.js` file to alloc the initial validator set.
3. Edit `init_cycle.js` file to change core blockchain parameters.
4. Edit `generate-btclightclient.js` file to change `initConsensusStateBytes`.
5. Run ` node generate-genesis.js` to generate genesis.json.
