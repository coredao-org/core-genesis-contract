# Core Genesis Contracts

This repo holds all the genesis contracts on Core blockchain, which are part of the core implementations of Satoshi Plus consensus. For more information about Core blockchain and Satoshi Plus consensus, please read the [technical whitepaper](https://docs.coredao.org/core-white-paper-v1.0.5/).



## List of Contracts

- [System.sol](./contracts/System.sol): This contract defines system constants (such as the genesis contract addresses) and various modifiers that can be used across the system to
limit the accessibility to function.
- [Foundation.sol](./contracts/Foundation.sol): This is the DAO Treasury smart contract. The funds in this contract can only be moved through governance vote. 
- [GovHub.sol](./contracts/GovHub.sol): This is the smart contract that manages governance votes.
- [CandidateHub.sol](./contracts/CandidateHub.sol): This contract manages all validator candidates on the Core blockchain. It also exposes the method `turnRound` for the consensus engine to execute the `turn round` workflow. 
- [ValidatorSet.sol](./contracts/ValidatorSet.sol): This contract manages elected validators in each round. All rewards for validators on Core blockchain are minted in genesis block and stored in this contract.
- [SlashIndicator.sol](./contracts/SlashIndicator.sol): This contract manages all slash and jail operations pertaining to validators on the Core blockchain.
- [PledgeAgent.sol](./contracts/PledgeAgent.sol): This contract manages user delegation, including both delegation of CORE from token holders and delegation of PoW from Bitcoin miners.
- [RelayerHub.sol](./contracts/RelayerHub.sol): This contract manages BTC relayers on the Core blockchain.
- [BTCLightClient.sol](./contracts/BtcLightClient.sol): This contract implements a BTC light client on the Core blockchain. Relayers transmit BTC block headers to Core by calling this contract. It also calculates powers of BTC miners in each round, which is used to calculate hybrid score and reward distribution.
- [SystemReward.sol](./contracts/SystemReward.sol): This smart contract manages funds for relayers and verifiers. 
- [Burn.sol](./contracts/Burn.sol): This contract burns CORE tokens up to a pre-defined CAP.



## Prepare

Install dependency:
```shell script
npm install
```



## Run Tests

```shell
# install test dependency
pip install -r requirements.txt

# generate contracts for testing
./generate-test-contracts.sh

# run brownie tests
brownie test -v --stateful false
```



Flatten all system contracts:

```shell script
npm run flatten
```



## Generate genesis.json

1. Edit `init_holders.js` file to alloc the initial CORE holders.
2. Edit `validators.js` file to alloc the initial validator set.
3. Edit `init_cycle.js` file to change core blockchain parameters.
4. Edit `generate-btclightclient.js` file to change `initConsensusStateBytes`.
5. Run ` node generate-genesis.js` to generate genesis.json.
