# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: System Contract CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "merge_test_script" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
#    runs-on: self-hosted
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
